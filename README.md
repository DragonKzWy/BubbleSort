# Number Sorter

## Description
Number Sorter is a Ruby application that receives a list of numbers and sorts them in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm. This project serves as an intermediate-level programming exercise, reinforcing array manipulation and sorting algorithm implementation in pure Ruby.

## Features
- Accepts user input as a list of numbers.
- Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm for sorting.
- Displays the sorted numbers in ascending order.
- Simple and efficient for small datasets.

## Installation
To use this application, ensure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can check your Ruby version by running:

```sh
ruby -v
```

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DragonKzWy/BublleSort.git
cd BubbleSort
```

## Usage
Run the script using the following command:

```sh
ruby BubbleSort.rb
```

Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces when prompted. The program will output the sorted list.

### Example
#### Input:
```
Enter numbers separated by spaces:
34 12 5 67 1 99
```

#### Output:
```
Sorted numbers: 1, 5, 12, 34, 67, 99
```

## Algorithm Explanation
This project uses the Bubble Sort algorithm, which repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until no more swaps are needed.
